## Introduction

Your CRM app is designed to help you manage and track interactions with your customers, leads, and prospects effectively. It allows you to store customer details, track communication history, manage tasks, and generate reports to gain insights into your customer base.

## Features

![Feature Image](/CRMAPP1.png.png)

- **Customer Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete customer information, including contact details and other relevant data.

- **Communication Tracking**: Record all interactions with customers, such as calls, emails, meetings, etc., to have a comprehensive history.

- **Task Management**: Keep track of tasks related to customers, such as follow-ups, appointments, and deadlines.

- **Dashboard and Reports**: Gain insights into your CRM data with visual representations and custom reports.

- **User Authentication**: Secure the app with user authentication and manage user roles for better access control.

- **Search and Filter**: Easily find and filter customer data based on different criteria.

## Requirements

Before setting up the CRM app, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Django (>= 3.x)
- Other required packages as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd crm_app/
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

## Configuration

Your Django project has a settings file (`settings.py`) where you can configure various aspects of the CRM app, such as database settings, email settings, and security options. Make sure to update this file according to your specific needs.

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Your CRM app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`. You can log in with the superuser account you created earlier at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to manage users, customers, tasks, and other data.

For production deployment, follow best practices, such as using a production-ready web server (e.g., Gunicorn) and a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx).
